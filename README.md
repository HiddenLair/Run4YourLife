# Run4YourLife

(Final Masters project of the Masters on Videogame Design and Development (UPC School, 2017 - 2018))

In the deepest of jungles, under the shadow of great trees, around gold and glorious temples... making fun of an almighty god was never THIS funny! 
Join the little and missbehaving Xankla or become the allmighty Wotha-Kha on a frenzied multiplayer race where someone should become the King of the Jungle!

On 'Run 4 Your Life' you will play on a group from 2 to 4 players where you would will have to choose between the two teams: play as a Runner, the 'Xankla', and run away from the other team, formed by just one player, the terrible 'Wotha-Ka', who will have to use all his skills and tricks to defeat all the Runners!
